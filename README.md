## API: 
The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by our users. http://www.omdbapi.com

## MVP: 
To create my werbsite i will use HTML, CSS. JavaScript and also i will use Axios to consume data from an external source, and render that data into the DOM. for styling i will use flexbox or CSS grid or maybe both of them.the most interesting part is my website will be  responsive for 3 screen sizes (including desktop) using 2 media queries (tablet and mobile).i will use hover effect in all of the movie use that will show on the my page(it's going to fun). 


## Post-MVP:
I am not sure what i am going to do with this App however,i will try to add new features to this app.
